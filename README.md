# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# Profiles App (Lab 1)

## Dev Container

> Talk about the image you are using here.!
For eg, if i were to use the Node.js dev container, I would write:
- Node.js dev container (image: `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/javascript-node:20`)
- `corepack enable` to use npm/yarn/pnpm reliably

## Getting Started
\ ```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open the shown URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173)
\ ```

## Build

\ ```bash
npm run build
\ ```

## Deploy (GitHub Pages via Actions)
- Ensure `base: '/profiles-app/'` in `vite.config.js`
- Push to `main`; the CI workflow will build and deploy automatically.
- Settings → Pages → Source: **GitHub Actions**

**Live URL:** https://dengxianqi.github.io/profiles-app/

## Notes
- Uses React + React-Bootstrap.
- We use components, props, and `.map()`.
